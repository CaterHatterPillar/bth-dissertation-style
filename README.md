bth-dissertation-style
======================

The BTH Dissertation Style is created to allow students at Blekinge Institute of Technology to collaborate in improving a standardised LaTeX thesis template.

The style is created to accommodate migration from [previous institution LaTeX styles](https://studentportal.bth.se/web/studentportal.nsf/web.xsp/faculty_of_computing) (herein denoted the _bth-thesis-latex style_) which students have no right to modify and distribute.
The BSD-licensed BTH dissertation style is meant to resemble said LaTeX style whilst allowing students to collaborate in its improvement thanks to its non-restrictive license.

At this point, the BTH Dissertation Style is in its infancy and there may be some inconsistencies in-between the style and the template its meant to resemble.
Such inconsistencies are listed below.

What users may expect when migrating from the _bth-thesis-latex_ style:
* Small (noticeable?) differences in chapter headings (paragraph spacing and non-italic typesetting).
* In the bth-thesis-latex style, bibliography titles are set to 'References'. In the BTH Dissertation Template, the title of user bibliographies is up to the user (will probably default to 'References' if you have not specified otherwise).
* Unlike the bth-thesis-latex style, the BTH Dissertation Style does __not__ feature the \listOfDefinitions command.
* Environments existant in the bth-thesis-latex template, but not in the BTH Dissertation style, are: noindentdescription, descriptionItalicA, descriptionB, VarDescription, VarDescriptionNoSep
* The BTH Dissertation Style \curriculum command is implemented differently than the corresponding command in the bth-thesis-latex style.
